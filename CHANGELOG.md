# CHANGELOG
## [2023-02-02]
### Added
 - Order numbers ( "No." column on the left )
 - pick/reset/open/drop tasks by order number ( by id still works, and it is default behaviour )
    as for order number is different for `list heap` and `list cur` you need to prefix order number with container name, example: `open cur3`
 - table title in bottom-right corner
